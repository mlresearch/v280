title: Learning of Patch-Based Smooth-Plus-Sparse Models for Image Reconstruction
openreview: xJpLu0Dicu
abstract: We aim at the solution of inverse problems in imaging, by combining a penalized
  sparse representation of image patches with an unconstrained smooth one. This allows
  for a straightforward interpretation of the reconstruction. We formulate the optimization
  as a bilevel problem. The inner problem deploys classical algorithms while the outer
  problem optimizes the dictionary and the regularizer parameters through supervised
  learning. The process is carried out via implicit differentiation and gradient-based
  optimization.  We evaluate our method for denoising, super-resolution, and compressed-sensing
  magnetic-resonance imaging. We compare it to other classical models as well as deep-learning-based
  methods and show that it always outperforms the former and also the latter in some
  instances.
