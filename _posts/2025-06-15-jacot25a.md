title: 'Hamiltonian Mechanics of Feature Learning: Bottleneck Structure in Leaky ResNets'
openreview: C8OsIiVcyC
abstract: 'We study Leaky ResNets, which interpolate between ResNets and Fully-Connected
  nets depending on an ’effective depth’ hyper-parameter $\tilde{L}$. In the infinite
  depth limit, we study ’representation geodesics’ $A_{p}$: continuous paths in representation
  space (similar to NeuralODEs) from input $p=0$ to output $p=1$ that minimize the
  parameter norm of the network. We give a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulation,
  which highlight the importance of two terms: a kinetic energy which favors small
  layer derivatives $\partial_{p}A_{p}$ and a potential energy that favors low-dimensional
  representations, as measured by the ’Cost of Identity’. The balance between these
  two forces offers an intuitive understanding of feature learning in ResNets. We
  leverage this intuition to explain the emergence of a bottleneck structure, as observed
  in previous work: for large $\tilde{L}$ the potential energy dominates and leads
  to a separation of timescales, where the representation jumps rapidly from the high
  dimensional inputs to a low-dimensional representation, move slowly inside the space
  of low-dimensional representations, before jumping back to the potentially high-dimensional
  outputs. Inspired by this phenomenon, we train with an adaptive layer step-size
  to adapt to the separation of timescales.'
