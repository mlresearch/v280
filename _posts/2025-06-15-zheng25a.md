title: White-box Error Correction Code Transformer
openreview: 6lfnSzJ5qE
abstract: Error correcting codes (ECCs) play a crucial role in modern communication
  systems by ensuring reliable data transmission over noisy channels. While traditional
  algorithms based on belief propagation suffer from limited decoding performance,
  transformer-based approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for ECC decoding.
  However, the internal mechanisms of transformer-based approaches remain largely
  unexplained, making it challenging to understand and improve their performance.
  In this paper, we propose a White-box Error Correction Code Transformer (WECCT)
  that provides theoretical insights into transformer-based decoding. By formulating
  the decoding problem from a sparse rate reduction perspective and introducing a
  novel Multi-head Tanner-subspaces Self Attention mechanism, our approach provides
  a parameter-efficient and theoretically principled framework for understanding transformer-based
  decoding. Extensive experiments across various code families demonstrate that this
  interpretable design achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
  decoders.
