title: Exact and Rich Feature Learning Dynamics of Two-Layer Linear Networks
openreview: J7dZuX0DGI
abstract: 'Deep neural networks exhibit rich training dynamics under gradient descent
  updates. The root of this phenomenon is the non-convex optimization of deep neural
  networks, which is extensively studied in recent theory works. However, previous
  works did not consider or only considered a few gradient descent steps under non-asymptotic
  manner, resulting in an incomplete characterization of the network’s stage-wise
  learning behavior and the evolutionary trajectory of its parameters and outputs.
  In this work, we characterize how a network’s feature learning happens during training
  in a regression setting. We analyze the dynamics of two quantities of a two-layer
  linear network: the projection of the first layer’s weights onto the feature vector,
  and the weights in the second layer. The former indicates how well the network fits
  the feature vector from the input data, and the latter stands for the magnitude
  learned by the network. More importantly, by formulating the dynamics of these two
  quantities into a non-linear system, we give the precise characterization of the
  training trajectory, demonstrating the rich feature learning dynamics in the linear
  neural network. Moreover, we establish a connection between the feature learning
  dynamics and the neural tangent kernel, illustrating the presence of feature learning
  beyond lazy training. Experimental simulations corroborate our theoretical findings,
  confirming the validity of our proposed conclusion.'
