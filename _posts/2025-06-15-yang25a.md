title: 'Meta ControlNet: Enhancing Task Adaptation via Meta Learning'
openreview: ju63pUpq0N
abstract: 'Diffusion-based image synthesis has attracted extensive attention recently.
  In particular, ControlNet that uses image-based prompts exhibits powerful capability
  in image tasks such as canny edge detection and generates images well aligned with
  these prompts. However, vanilla ControlNet generally requires extensive training
  of around 5000 steps to achieve a desirable control for a single task. Recent context-learning
  approaches have improved its adaptability, but mainly for edge-based tasks, and
  rely on paired examples. Thus, two important open issues are yet to be addressed
  to reach the full potential of ControlNet: (i) zero-shot control for certain tasks
  and (ii) faster adaptation for non-edge-based tasks. In this paper, we introduce
  a novel Meta ControlNet method, which adopts the task-agnostic meta learning technique
  and features a new layer freezing design. Meta ControlNet significantly reduces
  learning steps to attain control ability from 5000 to 1000. Further, Meta ControlNet
  exhibits direct zero-shot adaptability in edge-based tasks without any finetuning,
  and achieves control within only 100 finetuning steps in more complex non-edge tasks
  such as Human Pose. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/JunjieYang97/Meta-ControlNet}.'
