title: Closure Discovery for Coarse-Grained Partial Differential Equations Using Grid-based
  Reinforcement Learning
openreview: Pve4Pg0A1v
abstract: Reliable predictions of critical phenomena, such as weather, wildfires and  epidemics
  often rely  on models described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However,
  simulations that capture the full range of spatio-temporal scales described by such
  PDEs are often prohibitively expensive. Consequently, coarse-grained simulations  are
  usually deployed that adopt various  heuristics and empirical closure terms to account
  for the missing information. We propose a novel and systematic approach for identifying
  closures in under-resolved PDEs using grid-based Reinforcement Learning. This formulation
  incorporates inductive bias and exploits locality by deploying a central policy
  represented efficiently by a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).  We demonstrate
  the capabilities and limitations of our framework through numerical solutions of
  the advection equation and the Burgersâ€™ equation. Our results show accurate predictions
  for in- and out-of-distribution test cases as well as a significant speedup compared
  to resolving all scales.
