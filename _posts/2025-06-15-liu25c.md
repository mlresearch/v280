title: 'AgentHPO: Large Language Model Agent for  Hyper-Parameter Optimization'
openreview: HU3yfXcoKU
abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical in modern machine learning, requiring
  expert knowledge, numerous trials, and high computational and human resources. Despite
  the advancements in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), challenges in terms of
  trial efficiency, setup complexity, and interoperability still persist. To address
  these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
  to automate hyperparameter optimization across diverse machine learning tasks, which
  is named AgentHPO (short for LLM Agent-based Hyper parameter Optimization). Specifically,
  AgentHPO processes the task information autonomously, conducts experiments with
  specific hyperparameters (HPs), and iteratively optimizes them based on historical
  trials. This human-like optimization process largely reduces the number of required
  trials, simplifies the setup pro cess, and enhances interpretability and user trust,
  compared to traditional AutoML methods. Extensive empirical experiments conducted
  on 12 representative machine learning tasks indicate that AgentHPO not only matches
  but also often surpasses the best human trials in terms of performance while simultaneously
  providing explainable results. Further analysis sheds light on the strategies employed
  by the LLMin optimizing these tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability
  in various scenarios.
