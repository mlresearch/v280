title: The Computational Limits of State-Space Models and Mamba via the Lens of Circuit
  Complexity
openreview: bImlLT3r62
abstract: In this paper, we analyze the computational limitations of Mamba and State-space
  Models (SSMs) by using the circuit complexity framework. Despite Mambaâ€™s stateful
  design and recent attention as a strong candidate to outperform Transformers, we
  have demonstrated that both Mamba and SSMs with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision and
  constant-depth layers reside within the $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$
  complexity class. This result indicates Mamba has the same computational capabilities
  as Transformer theoretically, and it cannot solve problems like arithmetic formula
  problems, boolean formula value problems, and permutation composition problems if
  $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. Therefore, it challenges the assumption Mamba
  is more computationally expressive than Transformers. Our contributions include
  rigorous proofs showing that Selective SSM and Mamba architectures can be simulated
  by $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits, and they cannot solve problems
  outside $\mathsf{TC}^0$.
