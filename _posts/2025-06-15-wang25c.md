title: Grouped Sequential Optimization Strategy - the Application of Hyperparameter
  Importance Assessment in Deep Learning
openreview: YIhDWlfQsH
abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical component of machine learning
  pipelines, significantly affecting model robustness, stability, and generalization.
  However, HPO is often a time-consuming and computationally intensive task. Traditional
  HPO methods, such as grid search and random search, often suffer from inefficiency.
  Bayesian optimization, while more efficient, still struggles with high-dimensional
  search spaces. In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring how insights
  gained from hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can be leveraged to accelerate
  HPO, reducing both time and computational resources. Building on prior work that
  quantified hyperparameter importance by evaluating 10 hyperparameters on CNNs using
  10 common image classification datasets, we implement a novel HPO strategy called
  ’Sequential Grouping.’ That prior work assessed the importance weights of the investigated
  hyperparameters based on their influence on model performance, providing valuable
  insights that we leverage to optimize our HPO process. Our experiments, validated
  across six additional image classification datasets, demonstrate that incorporating
  hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can significantly accelerate HPO without
  compromising model performance, reducing optimization time by an average of 31.9%
  compared to the conventional simultaneous strategy.
