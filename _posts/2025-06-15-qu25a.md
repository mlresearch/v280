title: 'Vanishing Feature: Diagnosing Model Merging and Beyond'
openreview: KBSh5ChQIo
abstract: Model merging offers an efficient way to combine pre-trained neural networks
  but often suffers from inconsistent performance, especially when merging models
  with different initializations. We identify the ”vanishing feature” phenomenon,
  where input-induced features diminish during propagation through the merged model,
  degrading performance. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we reveal that
  this phenomenon underpins challenges like variance collapse and explains techniques
  like permutation-based merging, post-merging normalization, etc. We show that existing
  normalization strategies can be enhanced by precisely targeting the vanishing feature
  issue. Leveraging these insights, we propose the ”Preserve-First Merging” (PFM)
  strategy, which preserves early-layer features, enabling merged VGG16 models on
  CIFAR-10 to surpass the original models without post-training for the first time.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vanishing feature phenomenon extends to other
  contexts, such as model pruning. Applying post-pruning normalization to mitigate
  the issue significantly improves one-shot pruning performance at high sparsity,
  offering a simple and effective post-pruning solution. The code is available at
