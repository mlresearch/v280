title: 'Heterogeneous Decision Making in Mixed Traffic: Uncertainty-aware Planning
  and Bounded Rationality'
openreview: pxg38Rw63r
abstract: 'The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth of the deployment of automated
  vehicles (AVs). Clearly, AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will co-exist for many
  years, and AVs will have to operate around HVs, pedestrians, cyclists, and more,
  calling for fundamental breakthroughs in AI designed for mixed traffic to achieve
  mixed autonomy.  Thus motivated, we study heterogeneous decision making by AVs and
  HVs in a mixed traffic environment, aiming to capture the interactions  between
  human and machine decision-making and develop an AI foundation that enables vehicles
  to operate safely and efficiently. There are a number of challenges to achieve mixed
  autonomy, including 1) humans drivers make driving decisions with bounded rationality,
  and it remains open to develop accurate models for HVs’ decision making; and 2)
  uncertainty-aware planning plays a critical role for AVs to take safety maneuvers
  in response to the human behavior. In this paper,  we introduce a formulation of
  AV-HV interaction, where the HV makes decisions with bounded rationality and the
  AV employs uncertainty-aware planning based on the prediction on HV’s future actions.
  We conduct a comprehensive analysis on AV and HV’s learning regret to answer the
  questions: 1) *How does the learning performance depend on HV’s bounded rationality
  and AV’s planning*; 2) *How do different decision making strategies impact the overall
  learning performance?*  Our findings reveal some intriguing phenomena, such as Goodhart’s
  Law in AV’s learning performance and compounding effects in HV’s decision making
  process. By examining the dynamics of the regrets, we gain insights into the interplay
  between human and machine decision making.'
