title: Quantum EigenGame for excited state calculation
openreview: XFjwzut6c5
abstract: Computing the excited states of a given Hamiltonian is computationally hard
  for large systems, but methods that do so using quantum computers scale tractably.
  This problem is equivalent to the PCA problem where we are interested in decomposing
  a matrix into a collection of principal components. Classically, PCA is a well-studied
  problem setting, for which both centralized and distributed approaches have been
  developed. On the distributed side, one recent approach is that of EigenGame, a
  game-theoretic approach to finding eigenvectors where each eigenvector reaches a
  Nash equilibrium either sequentially or in parallel.  With this work, we extend
  the EigenGame algorithm for both a $0^\text{th}$-order approach and for quantum
  computers, and harness the framework that quantum computing provides in computing
  excited states. Results show that using the Quantum EigenGame allows us to converge
  to excited states of a given Hamiltonian without the need of a deflation step. We
  also develop theory on error accumulation for finite-differences and parameterized
  approaches.
