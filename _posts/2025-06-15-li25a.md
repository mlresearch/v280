title: Fast John Ellipsoid Computation with Differential Privacy Optimization
openreview: yfmFSc5ZPG
abstract: Determining the John ellipsoid - the largest volume ellipsoid contained
  within a convex polytope - is a fundamental problem with applications in machine
  learning, optimization, and data analytics. Recent work has developed fast algorithms
  for approximating the John ellipsoid using sketching and leverage score sampling
  techniques. However, these algorithms do not provide privacy guarantees for sensitive
  input data. In this paper, we present the first differentially private algorithm
  for fast John ellipsoid computation. Our method integrates noise perturbation with
  sketching and leverages score sampling to achieve both efficiency and privacy. We
  prove that (1) our algorithm provides $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and
  the privacy guarantee holds for neighboring datasets that are $\epsilon_0$-close,
  allowing flexibility in the privacy definition; (2) our algorithm still converges
  to a $(1+\xi)$-approximation of the optimal John ellipsoid in $\Theta(\xi^{-2}(\log(n/\delta_0)
  + (L\epsilon_0)^{-2}))$ iterations where $n$ is the number of data point, $L$ is
  the Lipschitz constant, $\delta_0$ is the failure probability, and $\epsilon_0$
  is the closeness of neighboring input datasets. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates
  the algorithmâ€™s convergence and privacy properties, providing a robust approach
  for balancing utility and privacy in John ellipsoid computation. This is the first
  differentially private algorithm for fast John ellipsoid computation, opening avenues
  for future research in privacy-preserving optimization techniques.
