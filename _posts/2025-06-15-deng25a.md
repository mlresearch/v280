title: Streaming Kernel PCA Algorithm With Small Space
openreview: Gfl6APFUri
abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique in machine
  learning, data analysis, and signal processing. With the increase in the size and
  complexity of datasets, it has become essential to develop low-space usage algorithms
  for PCA. Streaming PCA has gained significant attention in recent years, as it can
  handle large datasets efficiently. The kernel method, commonly used in learning
  algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), has also been applied in PCA
  algorithms. We propose a streaming algorithm for Kernel PCA problems based on the
  traditional scheme by Oja. Our algorithm addresses the challenge of reducing the
  memory usage of PCA while maintaining its accuracy.  We analyze the performance
  of our algorithm by studying the conditions under which it succeeds.  Specifically,
  we show that when the spectral ratio $R:= \lambda_1/\lambda_2$ of the target covariance
  matrix is $\Omega( \log n\cdot \log d)$, the streaming PCA can be solved with linear
  space cost. However, the standard PCA algorithm usually requires quadratic space
  due to matrix vector multiplication. Our proposed algorithm has several advantages
  over existing methods. First, it is a streaming algorithm that can handle large
  datasets efficiently. Second, it employs the kernel method, which allows it to capture
  complex nonlinear relationships among data points. Third, it has a low-space usage,
  making it suitable for limited memory applications.
