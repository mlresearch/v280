title: Asymptotic Behavior of the Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference in Singular
  Models
openreview: e9Isd3GFDb
abstract: Mean-field approximations are widely used for efficiently approximating
  high-dimensional integrals. While the efficacy of such approximations is well understood
  for well-behaved likelihoods, it is not clear how accurately it can approximate
  the marginal likelihood associated with a highly non log-concave singular model.
  In this article, we provide a case study of the convergence behavior of coordinate
  ascent variational inference (CAVI) in the context of a general $d$-dimensional
  singular model in standard form. We prove that for a general $d$-dimensional singular
  model in standard form with real log canonical threshold (RLCT) $\lambda$ and multiplicity
  $m$, the CAVI system converges to one of $m$ locally attracting fixed points. Furthermore,
  at each of these fixed points, the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the system recovers
  the leading-order behavior of the asymptotic expansion of the log marginal likelihood
  predicted by \citet{watanabe1999algebraic, watanabe2001algebraic, watanabe2001balgebraic}.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that for models with multiplicity $m=1$ the ELBO
  provides a tighter approximation to the log-marginal likelihood than the asymptotic
  approximation $-\lambda \log n + o( \log \log n)$ of \citet{watanabe1999algebraic}.
