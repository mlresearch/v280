title: Large-Scale Multiway Clustering with Seeded Clustering
openreview: xfA9mu6NQL
abstract: Multiway clustering methods for higher-order tensor observations have been
  developed in various fields, including recommendation systems, neuroimaging, and
  social networks. However, high computational costs hinder the applications of tensor-based
  approaches to real-world large-scale data. Here, we propose a large-scale multiway
  clustering framework under tensor block model, named LS-TBM, with accuracy guarantees.
  LS-TBM leverages seeded clustering to break down the expensive high-dimensional
  tensor clustering into two fast low-dimensional steps. Our two-step algorithm substantially
  reduces the time and space complexities from polynomial to logarithmic rates while
  maintaining the exact recovery of community structures, under certain signal conditions.
  We also establish the theoretical phase transition of LS-TBM performance with a
  key interplay between signal levels and seed sizes. Numerical experiments with synthetic
  data and real large-scale Uber Pickup data highlight LS-TBMâ€™s superior performance
  in practice.
