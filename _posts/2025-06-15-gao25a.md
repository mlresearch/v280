title: Learning Effective Dynamics across Spatio-Temporal Scales of Complex Flows
openreview: TU9e5yChcU
abstract: Modeling and simulation of complex fluid flows with dynamics that span multiple
  spatio-temporal scales is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering
  domains. Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows
  are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture
  dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose
  a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that
  leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive
  model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data.  GNNs
  represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex
  geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality
  reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal
  attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated
  the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past
  a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers.
  The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics;
  in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close
  to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.
