title: 'AdaProx: A Novel Method for Bilevel Optimization under Pessimistic Framework'
openreview: wRMu5wPgQ7
abstract: As a powerful framework for various machine learning problems, bilevel optimization
  has attracted significant attention recently. While many modern gradient-based algorithms
  have been devised for optimistic bilevel optimization (OBO), pessimistic bilevel
  optimization (PBO) is much less explored and there is almost no formally designed
  algorithms for nonlinear PBO with provable convergence guarantee. To fill this gap,
  we investigate PBO with nonlinear inner- and outer-level objective functions in
  this work. By leveraging an existing reformulation of PBO into a single-level constrained
  optimization problem, we propose an Adaptive Proximal (AdaProx) method which features
  novel designs of adaptive constraint relaxation and accuracy level in order to guarantee
  an efficient and provable convergence. We further show that AdaProx converges sublinearly
  to an $\epsilon$-KKT point, and characterize the corresponding computational complexity.
  Our experiments on an illustrative example and the robust hyper-representation learning
  problem validate our algorithmic design and theoretical analysis. To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first work that develops principled gradient-based algorithms
  and characterizes the convergence rate for PBO under nonlinear settings.
