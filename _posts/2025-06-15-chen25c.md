title: Enhancing Video Representation Learning with Temporal Differentiation
openreview: NgR6hYd3Xw
abstract: 'Taking inspiration from physical motion, we present a new self-supervised
  dynamics learning strategy for videos: **Vi**deo Time-**Di**fferentiation for Instance
  **Di**scrimination (ViDiDi). ViDiDi is a simple and data-efficient strategy, readily
  applicable to existing self-supervised video representation learning frameworks
  based on instance discrimination. At its core, ViDiDi observes different aspects
  of a video through various orders of temporal derivatives of its frame sequence.
  These derivatives, along with the original frames, support the Taylor series expansion
  of the underlying continuous dynamics at discrete times, where higher-order derivatives
  emphasize higher-order motion features. ViDiDi learns a single neural network that
  encodes a video and its temporal derivatives into consistent embeddings following
  a balanced alternating learning algorithm. By learning consistent representations
  for original frames and derivatives, the encoder is steered to emphasize motion
  features over static backgrounds and uncover the hidden dynamics in original frames.
  Hence, video representations are better separated by dynamic features. We integrate
  ViDiDi into existing instance discrimination frameworks (VICReg, BYOL, and SimCLR)
  for pretraining on UCF101 or Kinetics and test on standard benchmarks including
  video retrieval, action recognition, and action detection. The performances are
  enhanced by a significant margin without the need for large models or extensive
  datasets.'
