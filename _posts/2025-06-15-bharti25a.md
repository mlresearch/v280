title: Sufficient and Necessary Explanations (and What Lies in Between)
openreview: H43BmpeJII
abstract: As complex machine learning models continue to be used in high-stakes decision
  settings, understanding their predictions is crucial. Post-hoc explanation methods
  aim to identify which features of an input $x$ are important to a model’s prediction
  $f({\bf x})$. However, explanations often vary between methods and lack clarity,
  limiting the information we can draw from them. To address this, we formalize two
  precise concepts—*sufficiency* and *necessity*—to quantify how features contribute
  to a model’s prediction. We demonstrate that, although intuitive and simple, these
  two types of explanations may fail to fully reveal which features a model deems
  important. To overcome this, we propose and study a unified notion of importance
  that spans the entire sufficiency-necessity axis. Our unified notion, we show, has
  strong ties to notions of importance based on conditional independence and Shapley
  values. Lastly, through various experiments, we quantify the sufficiency and necessity
  of popular post-hoc explanation methods. Furthermore, we show that generating explanations
  along the sufficiency-necessity axis can uncover important features that may otherwise
  be missed, providing new insights into feature importance.
