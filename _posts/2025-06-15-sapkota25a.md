title: 'Dimension Mixer: Group Mixing of Input Dimensions for Efficient Function Approximation'
openreview: nJ4fuCF5aX
abstract: The recent success of multiple neural architectures like CNNs, Transformers,
  and MLP-Mixers motivates us to look for similarities and differences between them.
  We find that these architectures can be interpreted through the lens of a general
  concept of dimension mixing. Research on coupling flows, shufflenet and the butterfly
  transform shows that partial and hierarchical signal mixing schemes are sufficient
  for efficient and expressive function approximation. In this work, we study group-wise
  sparse, non-linear, multi-layered and learnable mixing schemes of inputs and find
  that they are complementary to many standard neural architectures. Following our
  observations and drawing inspiration from the Fast Fourier Transform, we generalize
  Butterfly Structure to use non-linear mixer function allowing for MLP as mixing
  function called Butterfly MLP. We are also able to sparsely mix along sequence dimension
  for Transformer-based architectures called Butterfly Attention. Experiments on CIFAR
  and LRA datasets demonstrate that the proposed Non-Linear Butterfly Mixers are efficient
  and scale well when the host architectures are used as mixing function. We devise
  datasets with increasing complexity to solve Pathfinder-X task. Additionally, we
  propose Patch-Only MLP-Mixer for processing spatial 2D signals demonstrating a different
  dimension mixing strategy.
