title: Fast and Efficient Matching Algorithm with Deadline Instances
openreview: TIneXGrWZt
abstract: The online weighted matching problem is a fundamental problem in machine
  learning due to its numerous applications.  Despite many efforts in this area, existing
  algorithms are either too slow or donâ€™t take $\mathrm{deadline}$ (the longest time
  a node can be matched) into account. In this paper, we introduce a market model
  with $\mathrm{deadline}$ first. Next, we present our two optimized algorithms (\textsc{FastGreedy}
  and \textsc{FastPostponedGreedy}) and offer theoretical proof of the time complexity
  and correctness of our algorithms. In \textsc{FastGreedy} algorithm, we have already
  known if a node is a buyer or a seller. But in \textsc{FastPostponedGreedy} algorithm,
  the status of each node is unknown at first. Then, we generalize a sketching matrix
  to run the original and our algorithms on both real data sets and synthetic data
  sets.  Let $\epsilon \in (0,0.1)$ denote the relative error of the real weight of
  each edge. The competitive ratio of original \textsc{Greedy} and \textsc{PostponedGreedy}
  is $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$ respectively. Based on these two original algorithms,
  we proposed \textsc{FastGreedy} and \textsc{FastPostponedGreedy} algorithms and
  the competitive ratio of them is $\frac{1 -  \epsilon}{2}$ and $\frac{1 -  \epsilon}{4}$
  respectively. At the same time, our algorithms run faster than the original two
  algorithms. Given $n$ nodes in $\mathbb{R} ^ d$, we decrease the time complexity
  from $O(nd)$ to  $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2} \cdot (n + d))$.
