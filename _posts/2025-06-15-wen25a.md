title: 'Bridging Domain Adaptation and Graph Neural Networks: A Tensor-Based Framework
  for Effective Label Propagation'
openreview: erHR9IqQBQ
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become the predominant tools
  for studying graph data. Despite state-of-the-art performance on graph classification
  tasks, GNNs are overwhelmingly trained in a single domain under supervision, thus
  necessitating a prohibitively high demand for labels and resulting in poorly transferable
  representations.  To address this challenge, we propose the Label-Propagation Tensor
  Graph Neural Network (LP-TGNN) framework to bridge the gap between graph data and
  traditional domain adaptation methods. It extracts graph topological information
  holistically with a tensor architecture and then reduces domain discrepancy through
  label propagation. It is readily compatible with general GNNs and domain adaptation
  techniques with minimal adjustment through pseudo-labeling. Experiments on various
  real-world benchmarks show that our LP-TGNN outperforms baselines by a notable margin.
  We also validate and analyze each component of the proposed framework in the ablation
  study.
