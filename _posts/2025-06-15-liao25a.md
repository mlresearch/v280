title: Provable Model-Parallel Distributed Principal Component Analysis with Parallel
  Deflation
openreview: n3SpSUzGi0
abstract: 'We study a distributed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework where
  each worker targets a distinct eigenvector and refines its solution by updating
  from intermediate solutions provided by peers deemed as "superior". Drawing intuition
  from the deflation method in centralized eigenvalue problems, our approach breaks
  the sequential dependency in the deflation steps and allows asynchronous updates
  of workers, while incurring only a small communication cost. To our knowledge, a
  gap in the literature – *the theoretical underpinning of such distributed, dynamic
  interactions among workers* – has remained unaddressed. This paper offers a theoretical
  analysis explaining why, how, and when these intermediate, hierarchical updates
  lead to practical and provable convergence in distributed environments.  Despite
  being a theoretical work, our prototype implementation demonstrates that such a
  distributed PCA algorithm converges effectively and in scalable way: through experiments,
  our proposed framework offers comparable performance to EigenGame-$\mu$, the state-of-the-art
  model-parallel PCA solver.'
