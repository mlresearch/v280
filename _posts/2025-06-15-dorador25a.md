title: Theoretical and Empirical Advances in Forest Pruning
openreview: eVAjcRE8tx
abstract: 'Regression forests have long delivered state-of-the-art accuracy, often
  outperforming regression trees and even neural networks, but they suffer from limited
  interpretability as ensemble methods.  In this work, we revisit forest pruning,
  an approach  that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of regression
  forests and the interpretability of regression trees.  This pursuit, whose foundation
  lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast success in empirical studies.  In
  this paper, we contribute theoretical results that support and qualify those empirical
  findings; namely, we prove the asymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over
  its unpruned counterpart under weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample
  generalization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main methods,
  which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the accuracy of pruned
  regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19 different datasets
  (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of scenarios tested, there
  is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal or better accuracy than
  the original full forest (in expectation), while just using a small fraction of
  the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction in the size of the forest
  is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be meaningfully merged into a single
  tree, obtaining a level of interpretability  that is qualitatively superior to that
  of the original regression forest, which remains a black box.'
