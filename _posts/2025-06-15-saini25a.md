title: A Case Study of Low Ranked Self-Expressive Structures in Neural Network Representations
openreview: vMGYwMFRKf
abstract: Understanding neural networks by studying their underlying geometry can
  help us understand their embedded inductive priors and representation capacity.
  Prior representation analysis tools like (Linear) Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)
  offer a lens to probe those structures via a kernel similarity framework. In this
  work we approach the problem of understanding the underlying geometry via the lens
  of subspace clustering, where each input is represented as a linear combination
  of other inputs. Such structures are called self-expressive structures. In this
  work we analyze their evolution and gauge their usefulness with the help of linear
  probes. We also demonstrate a close relationship between subspace clustering and
  linear CKA and demonstrate its utility to act as a more sensitive similarity measure
  of representations when compared with linear CKA. We do so by comparing the sensitivities
  of both measures to changes in representation across their singular value spectrum,
  by analyzing the evolution of self-expressive structures in networks trained to
  generalize and memorize and via a comparison of networks trained with different
  optimization objectives. This analysis helps us ground the utility of subspace clustering
  based approaches to analyze neural representations and motivate future work on exploring
  the utility of enforcing similarity between self-expressive structures as a means
  of training neural networks.
