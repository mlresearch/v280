title: A Validation Approach to Over-parameterized Matrix and Image Recovery
openreview: oyQnduevQw
abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from several
  noisy random linear measurements. We consider the setting where the rank of the
  ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from
  a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global
  optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth.
  We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small
  random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy
  the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the
  rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix
  rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth
  matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is
  stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the
  common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably.
  Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently
  used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image
  with a deep network.
