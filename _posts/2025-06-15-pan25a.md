title: 'RecCrysFormer: Refined Protein Structural Prediction from 3D Patterson Maps
  via Recycling Training Runs'
openreview: U9DhMKzXPT
abstract: Determining protein structures at an atomic level remains a significant
  challenge in structural biology. We introduce $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$, a hybrid
  model that exploits the strengths of transformers with the aim of integrating experimental
  and ML approaches to protein structure determination from crystallographic data.
  $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$ leverages Patterson maps and incorporates known standardized
  partial structures of amino acid residues to directly predict electron density maps,
  which are essential for constructing detailed atomic models through crystallographic
  refinement processes. $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$ benefits from a “recycling” training
  regimen that iteratively incorporates results from crystallographic refinements
  and previous training runs as additional inputs in the form of template maps. Using
  a preliminary dataset of synthetic peptide fragments based on Protein Data Bank,
  $\texttt{RecCrysFormer}$ achieves good accuracy in structural predictions and shows
  robustness against variations in crystal parameters, such as unit cell dimensions
  and angles.
